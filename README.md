# Project3_Group10

The following project consists of visualizations that show car accidents and car thefts in the GTA during the years 2018-2023. We have 7 visuals that show the following:

-Number of car thefts by month 
-Number of car accidents by neighbourhood (Only top 10)
-Number of car thefts by neighbourhood (Only top 10)
-Number of accidents by age group
-Number of car accidents by road conditions
-Leaflet map that shows the location where accidents occurred in the GTA (You can filter it based on fatal crashes and non-fatal crashes)

Additonally, we have a dropdown that can adjust every graph by the year we want to explore.
