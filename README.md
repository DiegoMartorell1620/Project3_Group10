## Introduction

You can view our app by going to this url: https://diegomartorell1620.github.io/Project3_Group10/
The following project creates a dashboard app with visualizations that show car accidents and car thefts in the GTA during the years 2018-2023. We have 6 visuals that show the following:

-Number of car thefts by month 
-Number of car accidents by neighbourhood (Only top 10)
-Number of car thefts by neighbourhood (Only top 10)
-Number of accidents by age group
-Number of car accidents by road conditions
-Leaflet map that shows the location where accidents occurred in the GTA (You can filter it based on fatal crashes and non-fatal crashes)



## How use app

A dropdown that can adjust every graph by the year we want to explore.

After selecting year, the the scatter plot in the center of the page will be updated to refelct the year and its car theft and accidents.

Then below, two bar graphs will be updated. The first graph shows the top 10 neighbourhoods with car accidents for that year and the second graph shows the top 10 neighbourhoods with car thefts for that year.

After scrolling further down, users will get to see two pie charts; one being a pie chart of the ages of the the individuals involved in the accident and the second is a a pie chart of the road conditions for the accidents.

At the end of our app there is a leaflet map that plots the accidents of a given year as interactive pop ups.
